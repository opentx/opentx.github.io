The team also develops the OpenTX Companion transmitter support software. OpenTX Companion is used for many different tasks like loading OpenTX firmware to the radio, backing up model settings, editing settings and running radio simulators.   
OpenTX Companion is available for Windows, Apple OSX and Linux.
