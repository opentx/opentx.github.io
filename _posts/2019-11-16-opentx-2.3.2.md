**2.3.2 SPECIAL RELEASE:**
 
  A critical bug affecting Horus emergency reboot has been found in 2.3.0 and 2.3.1. Depending on model configuration, the radio link may not always re-establish after an emergency reboot. This bug affects every model of Horus radio running 2.3.0, 2.3.1 or 2.3.2 nightlies (so X10/X10S/X12S/X10 Express, X10S Express).
  
  This special release 2.3.2 is made specifically to address this critical issue, and the only change compared with 2.3.1 is the fix for emergency mode for X10/X12
  
  While we urge any 2.3 Horus user to upgrade ASAP to this release, there is no reason for other radio users already on 2.3.1 to upgrade to 2.3.2.
  
  Changes that have being made in 2.3.2 nightlies are NOT included in this release, and have been moved to 2.3.3 nightlies
