**New since 2.3.10**

###### Backlight function
Backlight function has been reviewed and works as below
- If NO source is selected:
The radio behaves as usual if the backlight function is not active
backlight will turn on at 'on' brightness when function is active, regardless of radio backlight setting and state
this is comparable to legacy backlight function

- If a source is selected and backlight mode is set to OFF:
backlight is set to off level (but not turned off) when the function is not active
if backlight function is active and a source is selected, backlight is set to that source level (including screen off if set at -1024)

- If a source is selected and backlight mode is not set to OFF:
The radio behaves as usual if the backlight function is not active
if backlight function is active and a source is selected, backlight 'on level' is set to that source level (including screen off if set at -1024). This level is active only when the conditions for backlight to be on are satisfied.
