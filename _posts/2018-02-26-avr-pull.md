While reviewing some reported avr radio bugs, we have discovered a major issue affecting OpenTX 2.2.x on the following radios : 9x, 9xr, 9x128, 9xr128, gruvin9x and mega2560.

Installing 2.2.x on those radio will result in a corrupted Eeprom. The radio will look fine at first, but any use with Companion will wipe the radio and model settings.

As an imediate measure, while we continue to investigate, we have **disabled the download of 2.2.x firmwares for those radios**. We will publish a follow up on this as more information becomes available
