We are happy to bring you this release of OpenTX 2.2.2, with support for the FrSky X-Lite radio!

We expect this to be the last of the 2.2 series, with the exception of any serious issues being discovered after release.

**PLEASE NOTE** the following important information before hastily jumping on it:
Please back up your models and settings before upgrading so that you can go back to your previous version should you not like 2.2.2 or find issues that make it unsuitable for you. Use the "backup radio to file" companion feature for this to have an exact copy of what was on your radio.


- The manual has not yet updated to include all Horus documentation/OpenTX 2.2 changes, so get yourself a good coffee to wake up, and refer to the great communities for help e.g. openrcforums [here](http://openrcforums.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=45), RCGroups and threads like [this one](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?2823315-OpenTx-2-2-1). You can pop in our [chat room](https://chat.open-tx.org) where other users and/or devs may be available.

- Check during companion install that it installs itself in the correct directory, usually you want "Companion 2.2". If you used 2.2.0 release candidates a bug may cause it to install itself in "Companion 2.1", potentially overwriting your 2.1 install.

- SD card contents can be found [here](http://downloads.open-tx.org/2.2/release/sdcard/). Download the correct archive for your radio type, extract it to the root of an empty SD card and you'll have all needed files. Please note that some existing OpenTX sound packs that where designed for 2.1 won't work due to changes in the naming strategy, so you'll likely want to use those that are included in this archive until popular 3rd-party packs are adapted.

- OpenTX does not touch the internal flash of production Horus radios. Its contents do not need to be backed up and are not accessible in any way when OpenTX firmware is loaded.

- Due to changes introduces by Horus, image, sound, and script file names for ALL radio are restricted to **6 characters** in most places.

**WARNINGS:**

- If you were using 2.2.2 release candidates, you will want to set companion back to downloading release versions only to get the release firmware. 

- Companion now offers assistance for model conversion from one radio type to another. The transferred models NEED to be completely checked and validated before being used, as some things like switches assignments may not get converted properly. The proper way to transfer models from one radio to the other is: Select a profile for the destination radio, read the settings from the destination radio, open the source file or read the source radio, drag models onto the destination radio's window, write destination radio.

- The first versions of Frsky X10/X10s misuse the USB-C port for charging its internal battery. Do not plug anything else in there. For more details see here: [FAQ for X10/X10s USB-C port](https://opentx.gitbooks.io/manual-for-opentx-2-2/faq.html#usb-c-port-on-the-frsky-x10-and-x10s)

**Known issues:**

- If you get an "Invalid Language" error when trying to download firmware after upgrading from 2.1 open the profile settings and reselect your radio type, even if it is already correct.
- The progress bar in companion when reading firmware from a Horus is broken and will reach 100% at only 25% progress. Just wait, the window will close when the process is finished.

- Horus X12S production version and beta version use different hardware. Companion defaults to production hardware, for beta radios check the "pcbdev" firmware option in the profile settings.

Download and install Companion and use it to retrieve and transfer the latest OpenTX firmware to your radio after configuring the proper radio type.

**MUST READ : Xlite** : Xlite

Xlite uses a '+' pad for trims. One set of trims can be accessed directly with the '+', the second set needs '+' and pushing 'shift' at the same time. Depending on your radio mode, this can be convenient or not at all. We have introduced a solution that enable Aileron and Elevator of your actual radio mode to be always the default '+' usage. Unfortunately, the firmware that FrSky included in their first batch of Xlite does NOT include this feature, so this is a fairly big usage difference between shipped firmware and actual OpenTx  2.2.2.

It is highly recommended to update xlite shipped version to this version or a later opentx version.

**MUST READ : HORUS** : Horus bootloader

Thanks to the work by Raphael Coeffic and Arne Schwabe, a bootloader is now availble for Horus. It allows you to flash a Horus firmware much faster by using the bootloader. There are now 3 methods for flashing OpenTX:
 - by turning on your radio in bootloader mode (by first holding T4 and T1 toward the center, then pressing the power button), connect to USB and then flash with Companion
 - by putting the firmware on the SD card, then start bootloader mode (by first holding T4 and T1 toward the center, then pressing the power button), select write firmwware, navigate to it and press ENTER
 - by connecting the HORUS to usb in the off state and use dfu-util (through Companion) like before

**MUST READ : R9M** : R9M EU-LBT
